# doctor_clinic
## this program for simulate  doctor clinic
Write a Python program that simulates a doctor clinic from 12 pm to 4pm. On any
average day, about 10 patients arrive to the clinic at any given hour. The patients ages
typically are in between 20 and 60. Each Age from 20 to 60 is equally likely. The
clinic deals with the patients by a first-come first-served manner. Patient time with the
doctor is calculated by the following formula: patient time with doctor = (Age/5)
minutes. The output of the simulation are the average waiting time of the patients and
the number of remaining patients at 4pm. If patient time with doctor changes to
(Age/10) minutes, what are the average waiting time of the patients and the number of
remaining patients at 4pm?
